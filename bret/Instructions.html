        In the following screen, you will see a {{ NUM_ROWS }}x{{ NUM_COLS }}-matrix containing
        {{ num_boxes }} boxes on your screen.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are {{ num_nobomb }} boxes that is worth {{ BOX_VALUE }} cent each, and one box that contains a bomb that destroys everything that has been collected <b>in this task</b>.
        <b>The earnings you received in the previous experiment will not be affected by the bomb.</b>
        You do not know where the bomb is located.
        You only know that the bomb can be in any box with equal probability.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your task is to choose which and how many boxes you collect. You can select a box by clicking on it. You can also drag your mouse to select multiple boxes.
        You may deselect any boxes by clicking on it again. You can then press the "Confirm and Submit" to reveal where the bomb is.
    </p>
    <p>
        A dollar sign will be shown on each of your collected boxes that does not contain the bomb.
        If you collect the box containing the bomb, the bomb will explode and you will earn zero dollars. This is represented with a bomb symbol in red <i class="fas fa-bomb instruction-bomb bomb-selected"></i>.
        If you do not collect the box containing the bomb, you gain the value of the boxes you have collected. You can see the location of the bomb in grey <i class="fas fa-bomb instruction-bomb bomb-unselected"></i>.
